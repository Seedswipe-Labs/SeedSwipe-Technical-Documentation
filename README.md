# SeedSwipe-Technical-Documentation
For a detailed explanation of the SeedSwipe ecosystem we encourage you read the [whitepaper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-k_sakdcim4RfepOlIrGy83Ecxbldt8x/view?usp=sharing).

SeedSwipe is a digital equity ecosystem designed for the internet age. Our protocol enables founders to fundraise seamlessly; from inviting investors, to negotiating term, to issuing equity all in a single flow. We lower the barrier to equity investment by leveraging our mobile and web platform to enable investors to realise unprecedented liquidity on their investments by making secure investments on chain, trading equity with global peers in a single click.

Weâ€™ve developed the SeedSwipe protocol, a digital equity infrastructure for the backend of our app made up of three main components: SeedShare, SeedClaim and SeedBase. These work together to create a seamless transfer infrastructure for private equity. 


### SeedSwipe
The iOS App is going to be built natively using Swift, using the UIKit and SwiftUI frameworks provided by Apple. Networking calls between the frontend and backend will be made using the Combine library provided by Apple. Wallet connections and user login will be hosted through SeedBase.

The web app is going to be developed using Next.js to expose the smart contract functions also using a storage crate that allows more convenient API for the Soroban storage access. Hosted files will be securely stored using IPFS and the CryptoJS library to encrypt uploaded files. Typescript will be used  for the components and hooks of the UI.

Here's a web mockups, depicting how the web app would look like.


### SeedShare
SeedShare is a toolkit using Soroban smart contracts for asset tokenisation, allowing entrepreneurs to create and manage tokenised equity, automate compliance and raise venture funding. For investors, SeedShare provides a platform to realise unprecedented liquidity on assets that would have previously been immobile, enabling equity Shares to be traded like any other crypto asset.

For our working [PoC](https://github.com/Seedswipe-Labs/SeedShare-PoC) of SeedShare, we developed a working prototype using Solidity Smart Contracts, but for the final release, we will be developing using Soroban as mentioned in the whitepaper because Soroban offers enhanced performance and scalability, crucial for handling the high volume of transactions in equity trading. The lower operational costs, due to minimal transaction fees, make it economically viable for both founders and investors. Additionally, Soroban's focus on security and Stellar's compliance features ensure that our platform operates within the necessary regulatory frameworks, offering peace of mind to our users.

#### SeedShare.rs
SeedShare is an ERC1155 Based tokenised equity contract. It provides all the functions traditionally associated with an ERC1155 token contract, plus additional issuer controls designed (and legally required in some jurisdictions) to support for equity Shares. These features include forced transfers and Share recovery in the event that a Shareholder has lost access to their wallet.

#### SeedCoreCompliance.rs
SeedCoreCompliance works in tandem with SeedShare and the SeedBaseClaimRegistry, recording which attributes a prospective Shareholder must have in order to receive Shares. These attributes are known as claims. Unless a user is whitelisted, when a Share transfer is initiated the SeedCoreCompliance contract iterates through the necessary claims, comparing them against the claims held by the prospective Shareholder in the SeedBaseClaimRegistry.

#### SeedCoreRegistry.rs
SeedCoreRegistry keeps an on-chain record of the Shareholders of its corresponding SeedShare contract. It then uses this record to enforce limit-Based compliance checks, such as ensuring that a Share transfer does not result in too many Shareholders, fractional Shareholdings or that a Shareholder has not been frozen by the owner-operator.

#### Advanced Issuer Controls
SeedShare includes several advanced issuer controls designed to facilitate effective and secure equity tokenization, including:
- pause/unpause
- recover
- unfreezePartialShares/freezePartialShares
- batchFreezePartialShares/batchUnfreezePartialShares
- setAddressFrozen
- batchSetAddressFrozen

#### MetaData
SeedSwipe introduces a metadata model designed to make the essential terms of an agreement easily accessible and interpretable by machines. This approach significantly improves the compatibility and functionality of third-party applications, as it extracts and organizes crucial information from the agreement. Consequently, external machine systems can index and use this information efficiently.
```

} 
}
```


#### Encoding
In the creation and encoding of smart legal contracts, SeedSwipe establishes a secure connection between various elements. It achieves this by forming a two-way link, effectively mapping out the intended relationship between the legal contract and its smart contract counterpart, noted in the token URI. This method ensures a cryptographically secure integration, providing a safeguard that guarantees the integrity of information recorded off-chain, making it resistant to tampering.

An example of a token holders agreement, the steps are:

- The user inputs data via the application.
- This data is then used to create a structured metadata model using JSON.
- A new token is created in the SeedShare token contract with a unique identifier. 
- The metadata model is updated with the terms of the agreement to be enforced on-chain from the structured data model, referencing the token identifier.
- The compliance contract is updated with the terms of the agreement to be enforced on-chain from the structured data model, referencing the token identifier.
- The metadata is used to render the legal agreement in Markdown.
- The legal Markdown file is uploaded to IPFS.
- The metadata is updated with the legal agreement IPFS URI.
- The metadata JSON file is uploaded to IPFS.
- The SeedShare token is updated with the structured metadata model IPFS URI.


### SeedClaim
SeedClaim is the decentralized platform focused on credentialing, aiming to assist the SeedSwipe community in establishing and onboarding a list of reliable verifiers for credentialing services. It enables users to create digital identities though claims, which are digitally signed statements confirming specific attributes of an account. These identities play a crucial role in compliance procedures that depend on credentials. 


### SeedBase
SeedBase is a secure and user-friendly smart contract account designed to be light and efficient. It simplifies the user experience by eliminating the need for private key management while keeping the system fully decentralized. High-risk actions are protected with easy-to-use multi-factor authentication, requiring either multiple devices or team members to give their approval.

#### SeedBase.rs
At the heart of SeedBase is a smart contract wallet, working as a proxy account contract that lets users carry out transactions. This account is linked to a key-value store, holding numerous keys any of which can initiate a transaction.

- Multisignature: To go ahead with a transaction, the account needs approval from at least one additional key. This multisignature requirement lowers the risk of single-point failures and adds an extra layer of security for high-risk transactions. Users have the flexibility to set the number of required approvals depending on the type of transaction.

- Subdomain Identifiers: Users expect accounts to have easy-to-remember identifiers like names, username or email addresses. Instead of a lengthy 42 character public key, SeedBase assigns accounts and objects unique subdomain identifiers, creating a user-friendly and clear way for interactions.

- Local Keys: To balance ease of access and security while ensuring users maintain direct control of their assets, SeedSwipe employs numerous disposable, context-specific key pairs. These function as standard externally owned account (EOA) wallets but are used solely to sign transactions locally, meaning they never hold any funds. Funds are kept in the user's main identity account. WHen accessing their identity account from a new user, create a new key pair stored locally on that device. They then request permission to add this ew key to their account, which existing keys must approve. Once approved, the new key is added to the account.
